## prepareEscrowCreation

`prepareEscrowCreation(address: string, escrowCreation: object, instructions: object): Promise<object>`

Prepare an escrow creation transaction. The prepared transaction can then be [signed](#sign) and [submitted](#submit).

### Parameters

<%- renderSchema('input/prepare-escrow-creation.json') %>

This is a convenience method for generating the EscrowCreate JSON used by rippled, so the same restrictions apply.

Field mapping: `allowCancelAfter` is equivalent to rippled's `CancelAfter`; `allowExecuteAfter` is equivalent to `FinishAfter`. At the `allowCancelAfter` time, the escrow is considered expired. This means that the funds can only be returned to the sender. At the `allowExecuteAfter` time, the escrow is permitted to be released to the recipient (if the `condition` is fulfilled).

Note that `allowCancelAfter` must be chronologically later than `allowExecuteAfter`.

### Return Value

This method returns a promise that resolves with an object with the following structure:

<aside class="notice">
All "prepare*" methods have the same return type.

### Example

```javascript
const address = 'r9cZA1mLK5R5Am25ArfXFmqgNwjZgnfk59';
const escrowCreation = <%- importFile('test/fixtures/requests/prepareEscrowCreation.json') %>;
return api.prepareEscrowCreation(address, escrowCreation).then(prepared =>
  {/* ... */});
```

<%- renderFixture('responses/prepareEscrowCreation.json') %>
