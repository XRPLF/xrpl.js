# Transaction Overview

## Transaction Types

A transaction type is specified by the strings in the first column in the table below.

Type | Description
---- | -----------
[payment](#payment) | A `payment` transaction represents a transfer of value from one account to another. Depending on the path taken, additional exchanges of value may occur atomically to facilitate the payment.
[order](#order) | An `order` transaction creates a limit order. It defines an intent to exchange currencies, and creates an order in the Ripple Consensus Ledger's order book if not completely fulfilled when placed. Orders can be partially fulfilled.
[orderCancellation](#order-cancellation) | An `orderCancellation` transaction cancels an order in the Ripple Consensus Ledger's order book.
[trustline](#trustline) | A `trustline` transactions creates or modifies a trust line between two accounts.
[settings](#settings) | A `settings` transaction modifies the settings of an account in the Ripple Consensus Ledger.
[suspendedPaymentCreation](#suspended-payment-creation) | A `suspendedPaymentCreation` transaction creates a suspended payment on the ledger, which locks XRP until a cryptographic condition is met or it expires. It is like an escrow service where the Ripple network acts as the escrow agent.
[suspendedPaymentCancellation](#suspended-payment-cancellation) | A `suspendedPaymentCancellation` transaction unlocks the funds in a suspended payment and sends them back to the creator of the suspended payment, but it will only work after the suspended payment expires.
[suspendedPaymentExecution](#suspended-payment-execution) | A `suspendedPaymentExecution` transaction unlocks the funds in a suspended payment and sends them to the destination of the suspended payment, but it will only work if the cryptographic condition is provided.

## Transaction Flow

Executing a transaction with `RippleAPI` requires the following four steps:

1. prepare - Create an unsigned transaction based on a [specification](#transaction-specifications) and [instructions](#transaction-instructions).
2. sign - Cryptographically sign the transaction locally and save the [transaction ID](#transaction-id). Signing is how the owner of an account authorizes a transaction to take place.
3. submit - Submit the transaction to the connected server.
4. verify - Verify that the transaction got validated by querying with [getTransaction](#gettransaction). This is necessary because transactions may fail even if they were successfully submitted. It is recommended that you specify a `maxLedgerVersion` in the instructions when preparing a transaction because without it there is no way to know that a failed transaction will never succeeed in the future. It is impossible for a transaction to succeed after the network ledger version exceeds the `maxLedgerVersion` provided in the transaction instructions.

## Transaction Fees

Every transaction requires a *fee* to be paid in XRP. The fee is destroyed; it is not sent to any other party. The purpose of the fee is to prevent denial of service attacks on the Ripple network.

You can choose the size of the fee you want to pay or let a default be used. The fee is like a bid in an auction for slots in the next ledger closing. If the fee you choose is too low, your transaction will not be included in the next ledger closing. You can get an estimate of the fee required to be included in the next ledger closing with the [getFee](#getfee) method.

## Transaction Instructions

Transactions instructions indicates how to execute a transaction, complementary with the [transaction specification](#transaction-specifications).

```

A hash of the transaction that can be used to identify it. A transaction can be looked up by its ID using the [getTransaction](#gettransaction) method.
