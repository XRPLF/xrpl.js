## getOrderbook

`getOrderbook(address: string, orderbook: object, options: object): Promise<object>`

Returns open orders for the specified account. Open orders are orders that have not yet been fully executed and are still in the order book.

**Breaking change:** In ripple-lib 1.1.0 and earlier, orders returned by this method were not sorted correctly. Orders are now sorted correctly, from best to worst.

**See also:** An alternative way to get orderbooks is with `request` and [`formatBidsAndAsks`](#formatbidsandasks).

### Parameters

<%- renderSchema('input/get-orderbook.json') %>

### Return Value

This method returns a promise that resolves with an object with the following structure Both `bids` and `asks` have the same format:

<%- renderSchema('output/get-orderbook.json') %>

**Raw order data:** The response includes a `data` property containing the raw order data. This may include `owner_funds`, `Flags`, and other fields.

For details, see the `rippled` [book_offers method](https://xrpl.org/book_offers.html).

### Example

```javascript
const address = 'r9cZA1mLK5R5Am25ArfXFmqgNwjZgnfk59';
const orderbook = <%- importFile('test/fixtures/requests/get-orderbook.json') %>;
return api.getOrderbook(address, orderbook)
  .then(orderbook => {/* ... */});
```

<%- renderFixture('responses/get-orderbook.json') %>
