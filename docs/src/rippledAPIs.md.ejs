# rippled APIs

ripple-lib relies on [rippled APIs](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-apis/) for all online functionality. With ripple-lib version 1.0.0 and higher, you can easily access rippled APIs through ripple-lib. Use the `request()`, `hasNextPage()`, and `requestNextPage()` methods:
* Use `request()` to issue any `rippled` command, including `account_currencies`, `subscribe`, and `unsubscribe`. [Full list of API Methods](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-apis/#api-methods). 
* Use `hasNextPage()` to determine whether a response has more pages. This is true when the response includes a [`marker` field](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-apis/#markers-and-pagination).
* Use `requestNextPage()` to request the next page of data.

When using rippled APIs, [specify XRP amounts in drops](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-apis/#specifying-currency-amounts). 1 XRP = 1000000 drops.

## Listening to streams

The `rippled` server can push updates to your client when various events happen. Refer to [Subscriptions in the `rippled` API docs](https://developers.ripple.com/subscription-methods.html) for details.

Note that the `streams` parameter for generic streams takes an array. For example, to subscribe to the `validations` stream, use `{ streams: [ 'validations' ] }`.

The string names of some generic streams to subscribe to are in the table below. (Refer to `rippled` for an up-to-date list of streams.)

Type | Description
---- | -----------
`server` | Sends a message whenever the status of the `rippled` server (for example, network connectivity) changes.
`ledger` | Sends a message whenever the consensus process declares a new validated ledger.
`transactions` | Sends a message whenever a transaction is included in a closed ledger.
`transactions_proposed` | Sends a message whenever a transaction is included in a closed ledger, as well as some transactions that have not yet been included in a validated ledger and may never be. Not all proposed transactions appear before validation. Even some transactions that don't succeed are included in validated ledgers because they take the anti-spam transaction fee.
`validations` | Sends a message whenever the server receives a validation message, also called a validation vote, regardless of whether the server trusts the validator.
`manifests` | Sends a message whenever the server receives a manifest.
`peer_status` | (Admin-only) Information about connected peer `rippled` servers, especially with regards to the consensus process.

When you subscribe to a stream, you must also listen to the relevant message type(s). Some of the available message types are in the table below. (Refer to `rippled` for an up-to-date list of message types.)

Type | Description
---- | -----------
`ledgerClosed` | Sent by the `ledger` stream when the consensus process declares a new fully validated ledger. The message identifies the ledger and provides some information about its contents.
`validationReceived` | Sent by the `validations` stream when the server receives a validation message, also called a validation vote, regardless of whether the server trusts the validator.
`manifestReceived` | Sent by the `manifests` stream when the server receives a manifest.
`transaction` | Sent by many subscriptions including `transactions`, `transactions_proposed`, `accounts`, `accounts_proposed`, and `book` (Order Book). See [Transaction Streams](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-apis/#transaction-streams) for details.
`peerStatusChange` | (Admin-only) Reports a large amount of information on the activities of other `rippled` servers to which the server is connected.

To register your listener function, use `connection.on(type, handler)`.

Here is an example of listening for transactions on given account(s):
```
const account = 'rf1BiGeXwwQoi8Z2ueFYTEXSwuJYfV2Jpn' // Replace with the account you want notifications for
api.connect().then(() => { // Omit this if you are already connected

  // 'transaction' can be replaced with the relevant `type` from the table above
  api.connection.on('transaction', (event) => {

      // Do something useful with `event`
      console.log(JSON.stringify(event, null, 2))
  })

  api.request('subscribe', {
      accounts: [ account ]
  }).then(response => {
      if (response.status === 'success') {
          console.log('Successfully subscribed')
      }
  }).catch(error => {
      // Handle `error`
  })
})
```

The subscription ends when you unsubscribe or the WebSocket connection is closed.
