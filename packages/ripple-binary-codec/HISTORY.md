# ripple-binary-codec Release History

## Unreleased

### Added
* Support for `Single Asset Vault` (XLS-65)
* Adds new `STNumber` serialization type.

## 2.4.1 (2025-6-18)

### Fixed
* Adds conditional check for `PermissionValue` so custom definitions (based on previous v2.x versions) don't break.

## 2.4.0 (2025-6-09)

### Added
* Support for `Account Permissions` and `Account Permission Delegation` (XLS-74d, XLS-75d).
* Support for the `Batch` amendment (XLS-56).

### Fixed
* add `MPTCurrency` support in `Issue` (rippled internal type)
* Throw an error during serialization if a field is unknown, rather than silently throwing it away.

## 2.3.0 (2025-2-13)

### Added
* Support for the AMMClawback amendment (XLS-73)
* Support for the Permissioned Domains amendment (XLS-80).

## 2.2.0 (2024-12-23)

### Added
* Support for the Multi-Purpose Token amendment (XLS-33).

### Added

## 2.0.0 (2024-02-01)

### BREAKING CHANGES
* Bump typescript to 5.x
* Remove Node 14 support
* Remove decimal.js and big-integer. Use `BigNumber` from `bignumber.js` instead of `Decimal` and the native `BigInt` instead of `bigInt`.
* Remove `assert` dependency. If you were catching `AssertionError` you need to change to `Error`.
* Remove `create-hash` in favor of `@noble/hashes`
* `Buffer` has been replaced with `UInt8Array` for both params and return values. `Buffer` may continue to work with params since they extend `UInt8Arrays`.

### Non-Breaking Changes
* Update type definitions which causing errors in tests that the code already supported
  * `makeParser` to accept a `Buffer` in addition to `string`
  * `SerializedType` constructor allows not passing in a byte array
  * `Comparable` is now a generic type so that it allows `compareTo` methods to take more that the type itself.
* Eliminates 4 runtime dependencies: `base-x`, `base64-js`, `buffer`, and `ieee754`.
