/**
 *  The NFTokenOfferAccept transaction is used to accept offers
 *  to buy or sell an NFToken. It can either:
 *
 *  1. Allow one offer to be accepted. This is called direct
 *     mode.
 *  2. Allow two distinct offers, one offering to buy a
 *     given NFToken and the other offering to sell the same
 *     NFToken, to be accepted in an atomic fashion. This is
 *     called brokered mode.
 *
 *  To indicate direct mode, use either the `sell_offer` or
 *  `buy_offer` fields, but not both. To indicate brokered mode,
 *  use both the `sell_offer` and `buy_offer` fields. If you use
 *  neither `sell_offer` nor `buy_offer`, the transaction is invalid.
