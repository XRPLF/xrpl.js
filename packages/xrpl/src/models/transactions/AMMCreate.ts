 * Create a new Automated Market Maker (AMM) instance for trading a pair of assets (fungible tokens or XRP).
 *
 * Creates both an AMM object and a special AccountRoot object to represent the AMM.
 * Also transfers ownership of the starting balance of both assets from the sender to the created AccountRoot
 * and issues an initial balance of liquidity provider tokens (LP Tokens) from the AMM account to the sender.
 *
 * CAUTION: When you create the AMM, you should fund it with (approximately) equal-value amounts of each asset.
 * Otherwise, other users can profit at your expense by trading with this AMM (performing arbitrage).
 * The currency risk that liquidity providers take on increases with the volatility (potential for imbalance) of the asset pair.
 * The higher the trading fee, the more it offsets this risk,
 * so it's best to set the trading fee based on the volatility of the asset pair.
